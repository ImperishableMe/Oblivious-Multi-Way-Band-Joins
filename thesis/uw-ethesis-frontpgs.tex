This thesis introduces the first efficient oblivious algorithm for acyclic multi-way joins with band conditions, extending the classical Yannakakis algorithm to support inequality predicates $(>, <, \geq, \leq)$ without leaking sensitive information through memory access patterns. Band joins, which match tuples over value ranges rather than exact keys, are widely used in temporal, spatial, and proximity-based analytics but present unique challenges in oblivious computation. Our approach employs a novel dual-entry technique that transforms range matching into cumulative sum computations, enabling multiplicity computation in an oblivious manner. The algorithm achieves $O(N\log{N} + OUT \log{OUT})$ complexity, matching state-of-the-art oblivious equality joins while supporting full band constraints. We implement the method in Intel SGX and evaluate it on TPC-H and Twitter datasets, demonstrating practical performance and strong obliviousness guarantees under an honest-but-curious adversary model.
